# LotteryManager
This project was implemented to test the theory of winning the lottery.
A lottery ticket can have 16 numbers (naturally, not repeating). In total, from 1 to 80 numbers can fall out in the lottery. In this project, all winning and losing numbers are taken into account. In theory, we can assume that the number 77 won 33 times in one year and did not win only 12 times, accordingly, we will bet on this number.

- This tool helps to quickly add / delete / view lottery data using the PostgreSQL storage.
- It is also possible to display all the numbers that are most likely to fall out in the next lottery.
- It is possible to display 4 random numbers from the list of numbers most likely to fall out.
